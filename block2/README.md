## My solution

## Provide one or multiple examples of code that you’re proud of and explain why

- [this.history$](https://gitlab.pxlwidgets.com/pxl.widgets-heroes/rxjs-lessons/blob/block2_part2_sybille/block2/src/app/pages/home/home.component.spec.ts)
    - I am proud that I managed to use an Observable for my history list, which combines a zip, map and scan, something that I wouldn't have been able to do even a few days ago.

## Provide one or multiple examples of code that you’re NOT proud of and explain why

- [CountDown()](https://gitlab.pxlwidgets.com/pxl.widgets-heroes/assignments/blob/block1_sybille/beerApp/src/app/pages/brewery/brewery-list/brewery-list.component.ts)
    - I am not proud of it because it's an Observable that is not based on any other of my Observables. At the moment I am subscribing to the countDownService everytime I get an UserInput. 
    - If I had more time I would try to connect it to my other Observables instead of having it stand by itself. 



## What are some ways you would like to improve the application if you had time?

- connect my CountDown Observable to my other Observables

## What issues did you run into and how did you solve them?

- It was quite challenging to refactor the game after having a working version, but without Observable. It took some time to change my mindset and to understand the added value of Observables

    

## Research topics

### What topics did you come across that you particularly liked or found interesting?

- The huge number operators of RxJs

### What topics did you come across that you’d like to learn more about?

- different real life used cases of Observables and the operators

## Assignment

### What did you like about the assignment?

- developing a game was fun

### What didn’t you like about the assignment?

- the refactoring. The assignment might have less complicated if we had the instructions to use only Observables from day one
- not a real life example

## Workflow

### Do you think we briefed you sufficiently?

- yes, for the first part of the assignment. For the second part of the assignment it would have been nice to have the workshop with Tom earlier.

### Did you have enough support from your buddies while working on the assignment?

- Yes
